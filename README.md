# Impact-of-PCA-on-SVM-and-Logistic-regression
The main aim was to test the impact of dimensionality reduction(PCA) on the accuracy of binary classifiers SVM and logistic regression which predict if cancer is benign or malignant

Observation:

For lower values of K, accuracies were similar but for higher values of K, SVM performed better with considerable difference in the accuracy observed at K=30 where K is the number of principal components
